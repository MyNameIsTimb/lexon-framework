# lexon-framework
Some code snippets from Lexon Trainbuild, 2017-2018. Contains nothing that overlapped from FC&amp;N.
 
All subfolders (altnabber, lexon-framework, memberdrive) are individual addons.

You will need to peruse through each script and edit values that are unique to your server/account/whatever. E.g. SteamID overrides, Steam group page source code snippet for member drive, cookie names in altnabber's client script, etc.
